Okay, if that command gave no output, it means the Android NDK is not in the expected location, or it might be missing from this specific version of the Docker image.

No problem, we have two options. Let's start with a broader search.

-----

### \#\# Option 1: A More Thorough Search üïµÔ∏è

Let's try a different command to search for any directory that has "ndk" in its name. This is a more reliable way to find it.

Run this inside the container:

```bash
find / -type d -name "*ndk*" 2>/dev/null
```

If this command outputs a path (like `/android/ndk/25.2.9519653` or `/opt/android/ndk/r25c`), then **that's the path you need\!**

You can then re-run `./configure` and manually enter that path at the NDK prompt. If this command still produces **no output**, proceed to Option 2.

-----

### \#\# Option 2: Manually Install the NDK üõ†Ô∏è

If the search comes up empty, it means the NDK is not included in the container. We'll simply download and install it ourselves. It's a straightforward process.

Copy and paste the following commands one by one into your Docker container's terminal:

1.  **Install necessary tools**:

    ```bash
    apt-get update && apt-get install -y wget unzip
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the root directory**:

    ```bash
    cd /
    ```

3.  **Download the NDK** (we'll use version r25c, a stable and compatible choice):

    ```bash
    wget https://dl.google.com/android/repository/android-ndk-r25c-linux.zip
    ```

4.  **Unzip the file**:

    ```bash
    unzip android-ndk-r25c-linux.zip
    ```

5.  **Clean up the downloaded file** (optional):

    ```bash
    rm android-ndk-r25c-linux.zip
    ```

After these steps, you will have a new directory named `/android-ndk-r25c`. **This is your NDK path.**

-----

### \#\# Final Step: Re-run Configuration

Now that you have the correct NDK path (either from Option 1 or Option 2), you can confidently run the configuration script:

1.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    ./configure
    ```
2.  At the prompt for the NDK, enter the path you just found or created. For example:
    ```text
    Please specify the home path of the Android NDK. [/root/Android/Sdk/ndk-bundle]: /android-ndk-r25c
    ```

This will satisfy the configuration script, and you'll be ready to run your `bazel build` command.
