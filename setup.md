Of course\! Building a custom `tf-lite-select-ops.aar` with a specific page size requires compiling TensorFlow from the source. The easiest and most reliable way to do this is by using Docker, which prevents issues with dependencies on your local machine.

Here's the step-by-step procedure to build the AAR with a 16KB page size on your Ubuntu machine.

-----

### \#\# Prerequisites

First, you need to install **Git** and **Docker** on your Ubuntu system.

1.  **Install Git**:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install git
    ```

2.  **Install Docker**: Follow the official Docker installation guide to get the latest version. The basic steps are:

    ```bash
    # Add Docker's official GPG key:
    sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
    sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
    sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
    sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

    # Add the repository to Apt sources:
    echo \
      "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
      $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
      sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
    sudo apt-get update

    # Install the latest version
    sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin

    # Add your user to the docker group to run docker without sudo (log out and log back in for this to take effect)
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    ```

-----

### \#\# Step 1: Set Up the Build Environment

Now, you'll clone the TensorFlow repository and launch a pre-configured Docker container for building.

1.  **Clone TensorFlow**: It's best to check out a specific release tag for a stable build. For example, to use version `v2.16.1`:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow.git
    cd tensorflow
    git checkout v2.16.1 # Or any other stable version
    ```

2.  **Start the Build Container**: This command starts a Docker container and mounts your cloned `tensorflow` directory into it.

    ```bash
    docker run -it -w /tensorflow -v $PWD:/tensorflow tensorflow/build:latest
    docker run -it -w /tensorflow -v $PWD:/tensorflow tensorflow/build:latest-python3.9
    ```

    Your terminal prompt will change, indicating you are now inside the Docker container. All subsequent commands should be run inside this container.

-----

### \#\# Step 2: Build the AAR Library

This is the main step where you compile the AAR using Bazel, TensorFlow's build system. The command includes a special flag to force the 16KB page size.

1.  **Run the Bazel Build Command**: Execute the following command inside the Docker container. This will build the `.aar` for `arm64-v8a` and `armeabi-v7a` architectures, which cover most modern Android devices.

    ```bash
    bazel build -c opt --fat_apk_cpu=arm64-v8a,armeabi-v7a \
    --host_crosstool_top=@bazel_tools//tools/cpp:toolchain \
    --copt='-DGETPAGESIZE_FORCE=16384' \
    //tensorflow/lite/java/select_tf_ops:tensorflow-lite-select-tf-ops.aar
    ```

    Let's break down that command:

      * `bazel build -c opt`: Compiles an optimized release build.
      * `--fat_apk_cpu=...`: Specifies the target Android CPU architectures.
      * `--host_crosstool_top=...`: A necessary flag for cross-compiling for Android.
      * `--copt='-DGETPAGESIZE_FORCE=16384'`: This is the **key flag**. It forces the page size to be **16KB** (16 \* 1024 = 16384 bytes) during compilation.
      * `//tensorflow/lite/java/...`: This is the build target for the selective TensorFlow ops AAR.

    The build process will take a significant amount of time, as it's compiling a large portion of TensorFlow from scratch. ‚è≥

### \#\# Step 3: Locate and Use the AAR

Once the build successfully completes, the `.aar` file will be available within the `bazel-bin` directory.

1.  **Find the AAR**: The final library will be located at:
    `bazel-bin/tensorflow/lite/java/select_tf_ops/tensorflow-lite-select-tf-ops.aar`

2.  **Copy the AAR**: Since you are inside a Docker container, you'll need to copy the file to your host machine. Open a **new terminal window** (do not close the Docker one yet) and run:

    ```bash
    # Find your container ID
    docker ps

    # Copy the file (replace <CONTAINER_ID> with the actual ID from the command above)
    docker cp <CONTAINER_ID>:/tensorflow/bazel-bin/tensorflow/lite/java/select_tf_ops/tensorflow-lite-select-tf-ops.aar .
    ```

    This will copy the AAR to your current directory on your host machine.

3.  **Integrate into Your Android Project**:

      * Place the copied `tensorflow-lite-select-tf-ops.aar` file into the `libs` directory of your Android app module.
      * Add it as a dependency in your module-level `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts` file:

    <!-- end list -->

    ```groovy
    // build.gradle (Groovy)
    dependencies {
        implementation files('libs/tensorflow-lite-select-tf-ops.aar')
        // Other dependencies...
        implementation 'org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite:0.0.0-nightly-SNAPSHOT' // Make sure to include the base TFLite library
    }
    ```

You're all set\! You have now successfully built and integrated a custom TFLite Select Ops library with a 16KB page size.
